# üê∂ Tips Generator
This is a generator of tips, that uses a Public Api Rest.
This App generates daily tips. This comes from a front-end challenge, in which requests are made to an API, DOM manipulation, use of styles, components.
I created this front-end App using Html, Css, JavaScript and React.js.
